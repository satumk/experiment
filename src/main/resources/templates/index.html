        <h1>Welcome to Experiment</h1>
        
        <p>Experiment is a platform for experiments that can be conducted with kids.
        These experiments are designed to be done with a responsible parent and
        the platform waives all responsibility for accidents. The platform contains
        (eventually) experiments mainly in Physics, Chemistry and Biology. </p>
        
        <p>Navigation should be done through the links above, as they are more likely to work
            as designed compared to back and forward in browser</p>
